Three diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging datasets (dMRI) were used 
to generate all the derivatives in the initial repository layout, from publicly 
available sources. Data were downloaded from online repositories 
- http://purl.stanford.edu/rt034xr8593

Stanford dataset (STN). Four subjects were sampled from data collected at 
the Stanford Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging with a 3T 
General Electric Discovery 750 MRI (General Electric Healthcare), using a 
32-channel head coil (Nova Medical). dMRI data had whole-brain coverage and 
were acquired with a dual-spin echo diffusion-weighted sequence, using 96 
diffusion-weighting directions and gradient strength of 2,000 s/mm2 
(TE = 96.8 ms). Data spatial resolution was set at 1.5 mm isotropic.  
Each dMRI is the average of two measurements (NEX = 2). Ten non-diffusion-
weighted images (b = 0) were acquired at the beginning of each scan.

Human Connectome Project datasets (HCP3T and HCP7T). Seven subjects were 
sampled from data collected as part of the Human Connectome Project, using 
Siemens 3T and 7T MRI scanners. Only measurements from the 2,000 s/mm2 shell 
were extracted from these data and used to generate the data derivatives in 
our repositories. Data from the 3T and 7T scanners have different properties 
of resolution (e.g., HCP3T, 90 gradient directions, 1.25 mm isotropic 
resolution and HCP7T, 60 gradient directions, 1.05 mm isotropic resolution) 
and have been described before as has the processing methods used.
