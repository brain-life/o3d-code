10 candidate whole-brain tractograms were obtained by repeating tracking 
in each individual brain using 500,000 fascicles every time.

Tractograms were computed using tensor-based deterministic tracking method. 

Parameters settings used to perform tracking were: step size: 0.2 mm;
minimum radius of curvature, 1 mm; maximum length, 200 mm; minimum
length, 10 mm.  

Open source software implementing the method can be found at:
